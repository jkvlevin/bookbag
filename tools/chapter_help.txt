Hello there! Thanks for choosing Bookbag.

Here are some tips to get started:

1. Adding collaborators gives multiple professors the ability to edit the chapter. Only the chapter owner
   can add or remove collaborators. 

2. To edit your new chapter, you must first hit the Checkout button. This gives you permission to upload
   new files. Only one collaborator can have the chapter checked out at a time. When you're done making
   your edits, upload your updated files. This makes the chapter available for another collaborator to 
   check out.

3. How you choose to craft your chapter is completely up to you and your other collaborators. You may have 
   one source file that you all edit and re-upload, or you may all work on separate files and combine
   them at the end. You are free to collaborate however you like!

4. All files will be saved at every version! If you upload a file with the same name as an existing file, it
   will overwrite the old file in the new version. But don't worry, you will be able to view the old 
   file by clicking on the previous version! All your work at every upload will be saved no matter what.

5. When you want to make your chapter public, you must upload a final version in PDF format. You may continue
   working on your chapter privately, and you can change the public PDF at any point.
